## What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are software programs designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously using machine learning and artificial intelligence. They can process and analyze data, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems without direct human intervention. Their capabilities can range from simple automated responses to complex problem-solving and decision-making processes, depending on their design and the data they work with.

Think of them as digital assistants, but with the power to learn and adapt based on the data they encounter, making them highly versatile and valuable in various fields like customer support, data analysis, and automation. With AI Agents, businesses can streamline operations, gain insights, and provide better customer experiences, ultimately driving growth and efficiency.

AI agents are advanced language models designed to interact with the world. They can draft emails, book appointments in your CRM, create tasks in your management software, and so much more. Imagine having the power to automate and streamline any task you can think of – that’s the potential of AI agents! I hope to inspire you to dream big and create amazing things with AI.

What’s fascinating about AI agents is their power and flexibility, even with minimal coding. However, there’s always room to develop more complex applications, combining multiple agents to achieve incredible feats! In this masterclass, we’ll explore these possibilities and I’m excited to embark on this journey with you.

Here’s a basic diagram to give you an idea of what an AI agent looks like:

## Why two databases?
Qdrant and PostgreSQL serve distinct purposes in AI and data management, each excelling in different areas:

Qdrant is a specialized vector database designed for high-performance vector similarity search. It's ideal for AI applications that require handling large-scale high-dimensional vector data, such as recommendation engines, natural language processing, and image search. Qdrant is built to deliver fast, accurate results for complex queries against vector data.

PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is a general-purpose relational database known for its robustness and extensibility. While it can handle AI workloads and large datasets effectively, its primary strength lies in traditional structured data management, supporting complex queries, and ensuring data integrity. PostgreSQL is highly versatile and can integrate with various AI tools and frameworks, making it a reliable choice for diverse data management tasks.

In essence, Qdrant's focus is on specialized vector search capabilities, while PostgreSQL excels in managing structured and semi-structured data, offering a broader range of database functionalities.
