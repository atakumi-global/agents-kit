  # What are AI agents?

  AI Agents are software programs designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously using machine learning and artificial intelligence. They can process and analyze data, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems without direct human intervention. Their capabilities can range from simple automated responses to complex problem-solving and decision-making processes, depending on their design and the data they work with.

  Think of them as digital assistants, but with the power to learn and adapt based on the data they encounter, making them highly versatile and valuable in various fields like customer support, data analysis, and automation. With AI Agents, businesses can streamline operations, gain insights, and provide better customer experiences, ultimately driving growth and efficiency.

  AI agents are advanced language models designed to interact with the world. They can draft emails, book appointments in your CRM, create tasks in your management software, and so much more. Imagine having the power to automate and streamline any task you can think of – that’s the potential of AI agents! I hope to inspire you to dream big and create amazing things with AI.

  What’s fascinating about AI agents is their power and flexibility, even with minimal coding. However, there’s always room to develop more complex applications, combining multiple agents to achieve incredible feats! In this masterclass, we’ll explore these possibilities and I’m excited to embark on this journey with you.

  Here’s a basic diagram to give you an idea of what an AI agent looks like:

  # Installation
  This kit is developed to run throug Coolify on a local machine with a suitable Nvidia Grpahics Card . 

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
  > [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

  ##  Quick start and usage
  The main component of the Agents Kit is a docker compose file ready for deployment through Coolify. It is pre-configured with network and disk so there isn’t much else you need to install. After completing the installation steps above, follow the steps below
  to get started. The system is setup to have appropriate sub domains. After this is setup open n8n in your browser to set up a local n8n account. You’ll only have to do this once. Additionally open openwebui in your browser to set up a local OpenWebUI account. 
<br/>

  # Maintenance

  ## Upgrading

  In Coolify, click on redeploy. Coolify will automatically restart the system and download the lastest releases.

  ## Backups

  # Tips & tricks

  ## Accessing local files

  This Agents Kit will create a shared folder (by default, located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
  allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you’ll need to use in nodes that interact with the local filesystem.
